A python3 script that uses openCV and dlibs to scan a users face and then let the user know when they are tired by keeping track of the frequency of the user's blinks.

# Needed resources
You need this dat map file in order to use this script. You can get it here: https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
Be sure it is in the same directory as the script when executed!
